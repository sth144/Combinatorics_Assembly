This program generates combinatorics problems using random numbers n and r, with 3 <= n <= 12 and 1 <= r <= n - 1
;				The user inputs their guess for n choose r, and the program checks their answer against its own calculation, which
;				uses a recursive factorial procedure. The program tells the user if they are correct or not, and then asks them
;				if they would like to solve another problem
